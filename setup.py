"""Skoot: Accelerate your data science pipelines

Skoot is an open-source python package for data scientists and
other machine learning practitioners who would like to spend less time
developing bespoke solutions for data pre-processing. The library aims to
tie together as many common techniques and transformers in one location
as possible, doing so with a familiar scikit-learn API feel.
